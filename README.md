# React Music Player.

This is a Music Player made with React JS. It was very fun to do but it proved to be rather difficult and challenging but that's fine because i learnt a lot from it, lots and lots of event handlers, clearing intervals, lifecycle of the components, React hooks, MATH, canvas API, and more...

I'm really happy with the result, it has some bad things that i tried to solve and i couldn't but overall i solved almost every problem that i faced while building it, and that makes me really proud, at the end i think that's what matters the most.

NOTE: Everything was built from scratch, that means no libraries! (With a little custom slider as an exception);

### UPDATE: 09/07/2019

New feature added, now you can upload your own songs and play them in the app, keep in mind that they will only be able in the session.

Also, there were a lot of performance fixes and now the app is blazing fast!
